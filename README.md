Portfolio Optimization and Performance Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of portfolio allocation strategies as part of the Computational Finance course (2023-2024). The project focuses on constructing and analyzing efficient portfolios using sector and factor indices of the S&P 500 under different constraints and methodologies.

The analysis is conducted using MATLAB, and results are presented through tables and plots in the report.

Data Sources
📂 prices.xlsx – Contains price data for sector and factor indices.
📂 capitalizations.xlsx – Provides market capitalization values as of October 2024.
Project Tasks
📌 Portfolio Construction and Optimization
1️⃣ Efficient Frontier & Standard Portfolios

Computed the Minimum Variance Portfolio and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio under standard constraints.
2️⃣ Portfolio Optimization with Sector Constraints

Introduced restrictions on sector exposures and recomputed optimal portfolios.
3️⃣ Robust Optimization (Resampling Method)

Applied resampling techniques to improve the stability of portfolio allocations.
4️⃣ Black-Litterman Model

Incorporated investor views to refine portfolio construction.
5️⃣ Alternative Portfolio Strategies

Constructed Maximum Diversification, Maximum Entropy, and PCA-based Portfolios.
6️⃣ Risk-Based Optimization

Optimized a portfolio based on the VaR-modified Sharpe Ratio.
7️⃣ Performance Analysis

Compared all portfolios in terms of returns, risk, and diversification, using an equally weighted portfolio as a benchmark.
📌 Out-of-Sample Evaluation (2024 Data)
Analyzed how portfolio performance evolved using out-of-sample data.
