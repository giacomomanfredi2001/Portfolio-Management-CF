Portfolio Optimization and Performance Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of portfolio allocation strategies as part of the Computational Finance course (2023-2024). The project focuses on constructing and analyzing efficient portfolios using sector and factor indices of the S&P 500 under different constraints and methodologies.

The analysis is conducted using MATLAB, and results are presented through tables and plots in the report.

## Portfolio Construction and Optimization
1️ Efficient Frontier & Standard Portfolios:
Computed the Minimum Variance Portfolio and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio under standard constraints.

2️ Portfolio Optimization with Sector Constraints:
Introduced restrictions on sector exposures and recomputed optimal portfolios.

3️ Robust Optimization (Resampling Method):
Applied resampling techniques to improve the stability of portfolio allocations.

4️ Black-Litterman Model:
Incorporated investor views to refine portfolio construction.

5️ Alternative Portfolio Strategies:
Constructed Maximum Diversification, Maximum Entropy, and PCA-based Portfolios.

6️ Risk-Based Optimization:
Optimized a portfolio based on the VaR-modified Sharpe Ratio.

7️ Performance Analysis:
Compared all portfolios in terms of returns, risk, and diversification, using an equally weighted portfolio as a benchmark.

## Out-of-Sample Evaluation (2024 Data)
Analyzed how portfolio performance evolved using out-of-sample data.

Project Files:  
MATLAB Code, Scripts for portfolio optimization, risk assessment, and backtesting.
